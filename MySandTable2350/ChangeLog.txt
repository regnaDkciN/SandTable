Arduino UNO to Adafruit Metro 2350 Sand Table Changes
=====================================================

- Data type changes:
    + Since UNO was tight on space, all data types were declared as the smallest
      size that would do the job.  Generally (u)int16_t.  But the 2530 has lots
      of memory (compared to the UNO), so size is unimportant.  Speed is a 
      higher priority.  As a result, almost all data types were changed fast
      types.  For example, uint16_6 becomes uint_fast16_t, etc.
- Speed delay value changes:
    + The UNO timer clock period was set up to 4 uSed.  The 2350 timer clock
      runs at 1 uSec.  To account for this, all speed delay values were multiplied
      by 4.  For example SPEED_DELAY_MIN_VAL was changed from 25 on the UNO to
      100 on the 2350, etc.
- Different ISR handling.
    + The UNO needs to setup the timer clock rate before use:
        TCCR1A = 0;           // Init Timer1A (for rotation motor).
        TCCR1B = 0;           // Init Timer1B (for in/out motor).

        TCCR1B |= B00000011;  // Prescaler = 64. (4 microsecond tick).
        OCR1A = 1000;         // Timer Compare1A Register.
        OCR1B = 1000;         // Timer Compare1B Register.

        TIMSK1 |= B00000110;  // Only use one interupt.
        
      The 2350 already has its timer running at 1MHz.
    + The UNO used a simple interrupt setup with "ISR(vector)" indicating that
      a timer interrupt exists, and heads the interrupt handler itself.
      
        ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect)
        {
            OCR1A = TCNT1 + RotDelay;    
            ISR code            
        }
        ISR(TIMER1_COMPB_vect)
        {
            OCR1B = TCNT1 + InOutDelay;
            ISR code
        }

      The 2350 handles timer interrupts more normally in that the ISR must be declared
      before use, and added to the timer list before it can be used.
      
        int64_t RotaryServoIsr(__unused alarm_id_t id, __unused void *user_data);
        int64_t InOutServoIsr(__unused alarm_id_t id, __unused void *user_data);
        
        add_alarm_in_us(1000000, RotaryServoIsr, NULL, false);
        add_alarm_in_us(1000000, InOutServoIsr,  NULL, false);
        
        int64_t RotaryServoIsr(__unused alarm_id_t id, __unused void *user_data)
        {
            ISR code
            return -RotDelay;
        }
        int64_t InOutServoIsr(__unused alarm_id_t id, __unused void *user_data)
        {
            ISR code
            return -InOutDelay;
        }
    + In order for interrupt to repeat, the UNO bumps the corresponding OCR1x 
      register at the start of each ISR. as shown above.  The 2350 returns
      the delay value from its ISR as a negative value, indicating that the next
      tick should occur exactly that many microseconds after the time the current 
      ISR triggered.
- Speed increments/decrements in HandleRemoteCommands() are adjusted by a factor
  of 4 to account for the timer speed differences noted above.
- The UNO used an unused analog input and a function - GenerateRandomSeed() - to
  generate a random seed at startup.  The 2350 has a hardware true random number
  generator with a standard function - get_rand_32() - to generate a 32-bit
  random number.  So GenerateRandomSeed() was removed for the 2350.
- UNO supplies a squaref() function to square a float value.  The 2350 supplies
  a function named sq() that does the same thing. So uses of squaref() were
  changed to sq().
- The rotary servo ISR contains logic to generate compensation pulses in the
  inout servo based on rotary motion.  Part of this logic uses a short delay
  to affect a pulse on the inout servo.  In the UNO, a pulse delay of 1 microsecond
  was used.  However, since the 2350 is so much faster, the pulse delay was 
  changed to 5 microseconds.
- The 2350 includes an SD card holder and a power switch that the UNO doesn't have.
  Both of these are mounted on edges of the card.  To accommodate these devices,
  the mounting bumper was modified to add notches in the appropriate spots.
- Note that the UNO firmware uses D12 as the enable for the rotation axis.  On the 
  2350, this pin is used for other purposes, and is not brought out to a header
  pin.  In its place, D22 is brought out on the 2350.  As a result, the 2350 
  code was changed to initialize D22 as an output, and remapped the enable to
  use D22 instead.
- SerialLog changes. Removed LOG_U() macro, and replaced all serial logging with
  LOG_F() calls that use printf() style handling.
- Faceplate USB hole needs to be lowered by 2mm and height reduced to 10mm.
- Temporarily changed all floats and float operations to doubles to work around a
  2350 FPU compiler issue #2429:
     https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/pull/2429
  The issue has been fixed on the development branch, but not added to the release
  branch yet.  When it is released, this sand table code will restore operation
  with floats, as double precision is not needed.  Will change the following back
  when compiler FP fix is released:
    double -> float_t
    cos    -> cosf
    sin    -> sinf
    hypot  -> hypotf
    atan2  -> atan2f
    round  -> roundf
    trunc  -> truncf
    sqrt   -> sqrtf
    pow    -> powf
- Arduino UNO is a 5V device. 2350 is 3.3V.  Changed the pot voltage from the CNC
  shield 5V output to its 3.3V output (next to the RST pin).
- The MOSFET used for the UNO version (IRFZ44N) has a Gate Threshold Voltage
  (VGS) of 2-4 volts.  This is a little too high for the 3.3V 2350 and did
  not fully turn on.  Replaced the IRFZ44N with IRLZ44N 
    https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBKH4XGL
  which has a VGS of 1-2 volts.  This allowed the MOSFET to turn on fully.  
  Also added a 100K resistor between the gate and source to keep the MOSFET from
  conducting at power-up.
- Found a lot of noise on the 2350 analog inputs.  This showd up as LED flicker
  at lower brightnesses.  To compensate for this, the pot readings (analog inputs)
  were configured with a resolution of 12 bits, then shifted right by 4 bits after
  reading.  This effectively produced an 8 bit resolution, which is fine for the
  sand table application, but eliminated the noise/flicker issue.
- Also changed the PWM (LED) output frequency to 100,000 to help reduce flicker.
- Not 2350 related, but added LED update while homing.
